Version 1.1

Binary distributions of the Shibboleth code are available.
Information on obtaining and installing binaries can be found at
http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/ and in the deploy guide in this
directory.

This document provides details for those wishing to build from source.

JAVA / ORIGIN

There are a fairly large number of dependent Java class libraries required
to build Shibboleth, but all the needed jars are currently included.
The binary distribution for the origin site components includes the Java
source. The binaries can also be built easily using Ant, which is also included.

The following commands will build this release of Shibboleth

$ cd shibboleth/java
$ ./ant build-util
$ ./ant

The JavaDocs can be generated with the following command:

$ ./ant javadocs

The origin code is largely contained in a Java webapp (shibboleth.war) that
you would deploy with a J2EE engine like Tomcat. From this point, refer to
the deploy guide for more details.
