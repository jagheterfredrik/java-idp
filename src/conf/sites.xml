	The following are origin and target definitions for example installations
	that can be run together on the same box after installation.
	
	The Name attributes that contain what look like URLs are just identifiers.
	The reserved "example.org" value will only work in private testing or against
	sample installations.
	
	The Location attributes have to be valid for your installation so if you want
	to use actual hostnames or change where your software lives, just modify as needed.
	
	Once you join a federation or establish trust with another installation, you will
	use (or be given in signed form) similar metadata to describe and locate sites
	and services.

    <OriginSite> elements are used by all versions of the Shibboleth target software
    and WAYF to determine the set of origins to accept users from and related information
    about the names of certificates they will use.
    
    <DestinationSite> elements are used by Shibboleth 1.2 origin site software to
    "verify" incoming requests from 1.2 targets. 1.1 targets are handled in a
    compatibility mode by treating the request in accordance with the
    defaultRelyingParty value. Additionally, 1.2 targets that cannot be matched to
    a known DestinationSite are also treated in this fashion.
