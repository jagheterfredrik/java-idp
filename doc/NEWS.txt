Version 1.2

This release represents a fully compatible minor update 
to the Shibboleth 1.0 release, and is considered to be 
ready for production use.

New features in 1.2

Origin
-----------------

Multi-federation support.  Most origin configuration,
including signing credentials and identifiers, can be
overriden depending on the recipient of the assertions.

Simplified application architecture.  Both origins
and targets are now referred to using a single 
identifier called a "provider id".

The Attribute Authority can be configured to answer 
requests with multiple SAML Subject formats, 
increasing interoperability with other SAML-based 
software.

Signing credentials can now be loaded from a variety
of formats, including those commonly used with OpenSSL.

The origin now validates all requests from 1.2+ targets
against federation metadata.

Compatibility with 1.1 targets.

Separate logs are created for errors and transaction 
auditing.

Easier logging configuration.

Support is included for pulling attribute data from SQL 
databases using JDBC.  The JDBC Data Connector includes 
support for conection pooling and prepared statements. 

Mechanism for throttling requests to the Handle Service.  
This improves performance by preventing the server from 
becoming saturated with signing requests.

Support for signatures on all SAML Assertions and 
Responses, which allows for more interoperability
with other SAML-based software.

Attribute Release Policies can contain match functions 
on attribute values.  This allows the release of specific 
values based on regular expression.

Support has been added to the Attribute Authority for 
using alternate data connectors in the event of a 
failure.

The resolvertest program can now process and enforce 
Attribute Release Policies.

Updated library dependencies, including OpenSAML and XML 
Security.

Many important bug fixes
